Pwoxi Tracker project Management app in making.

Idea is based on my daily project management related stuff, so I decided to combine everything related to my daily routine in some sort of web based application.

Source code will be available FREE of cost and will remain open source. If you wish to be member of development team then you might have to wait until I am finished with at least alpha version.

Application based on CodeIgniter MVC framework, jQuery and some custom libraries by open source community.

Development of this project is sponsored by people @ Pwoxi Solutions.
